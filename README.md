> *Task scheduling server for scheduling tasks with inter-process communication that can scale horizontally between nodes*

**Mori** is a experimental task scheduling server that schedules all sorts of tasks that can be scaled vertically between nodes with IPC support that can delegate with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) or [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com) to provide scalable inter-process communication between the Mori server and your application.
